------TODO----------


(1) Refactor Code into functions to allow better reading style and allow better implementation of additional Code.
  (1.1) MAKE IT MORE READABLE ESPECIALLY THE CUBERENDERER!!!!!!!!
(2) Add Cube Struct to store Data
  (2.1) Should store 6 Pointers to Next Cube Objects? // Need More Information for better understanding
    (2.1.1) Usage: Better Draw Calling. Cube face should not be drawn if it is obstructed by another face/cube
    (2.1.2) Pro: Better Performance. We Dont need to draw unnecessary faces. Better Draw calls.
    (2.1.3) Cons: We need to keep track of every new cube added and its neighbours. We also need to update the neighbours list
                  Before adding cube we need to determine exactly which cubes face will be obstructed. Performance Heavy?
    (2.1.4) Add an texture atlas to implement different textures. Created cubes need to be initialized with an enum of a type of             texture you want to use.
